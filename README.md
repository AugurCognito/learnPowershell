## Prerequsites
1. [Powershell 7](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/tag/v7.1.3)
1. Some text editor
1. Prior knowledge of programming(not really but it will tremendosuly help)

## How to Run Powershell Scripts?
In powershell enter powershell script file path...and thats it.
You may face an error saying-
 `<script> cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.`
 In that case simply run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` command in powershell shell with elevated permissions.
## How to go this to work?
Simply clone the directory or download the zip file and then view/edit files using any text editor. After that read run and modify scripts to learn powershell scripting.
