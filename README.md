# How to Run Powershell Scripts?
In powershell enter powershell script file path...and thats it.
You may face an error saying-
 `<script path> cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.`
 In that case simply run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` in powershell with elevated permissions.
